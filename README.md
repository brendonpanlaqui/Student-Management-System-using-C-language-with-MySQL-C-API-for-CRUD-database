Welcome to the Student Management System (SMS) – a C program designed to manage and organize student information stored in a MySQL database. This system allows you to perform various tasks for CRUD operations, such as adding, updating, and deleting student records, inputting grades, and viewing student data.

This system was developed by Brendon L. Panlaqui, a first-year BSCS student and leader of the group for final project at City College of Angeles. 

REQUIREMENTS: 
Before running the program, make sure you have the following:
- MariaDB or MySQL server installed.
- C compiler (e.g., GCC) installed.

1. Create a database named `group1` in your MariaDB/MySQL server.
2. Run the program, and it will automatically create the necessary tables (`Students` and `Grades`) if they do not exist.
